Teaches 2-Look OLL and PLL algorithms with the help of computer vision

# Usage


1. Ensure that OpenCV is installed properly on your machine.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the repository.

3. Type the following into the terminal to compile the program.
```bash
make teacher
```

4. Type the following into the terminal to start the program.
```bash
./teacher
```

5. Ensure that your cube is solved up through the first stage of 2-Look OLL and follow the instructions in the terminal.

6. Capture the front, right, back, and left sides of the cube while making sure
the pieces are being correctly identified.

7. Perform the algorithm received from the program to finish the OLL step. Then,
do the first step of 2-Look PLL.

8. Once again, capture the front, right, back, and left sides of the cube while making sure
the pieces are being correctly identified.

9. Perform the algorithm received from the program to finish the PLL step.

10. The cube should now be solved!


<!-- 1. Open nbaPredict.py
2. Edit the call to makeInterpretPrediction with desired date of games, season, and the start date of the season

3. Run the program either through the terminal or an IDE
4. Wait ~1-3 minutes for model to finish scraping stats and predicting outcomes
5. Outcomes are outputted as the percent chance that the home team will defeat the away team

### **Past Predictions**
1. Open makePastPredictions.py
2. Edit the call to makePastPredictions with desired start date, end date, season, start date of the season, and output
filenames. NOTE: The start date should be at least three days after the season begins and the end date is non-inclusive.

3. Run the program either through the terminal or an IDE
4. Two CSV files will be saved in the Data folder. One holds the gameData and the other holds the predictions for the games. The time to execute will vary greatly from a couple minutes to a several hours depending on the range between the start and end date.
